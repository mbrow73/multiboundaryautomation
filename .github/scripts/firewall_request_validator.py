firewall_request_validator.py

This script validates firewall rule requests submitted via GitHub issues. It expects
to be passed the path to the GitHub event payload (a JSON file provided by
GitHub Actions in the GITHUB_EVENT_PATH environment variable). The payload must
contain an "issue" object with a "body" field representing the Markdown issue
content.

The validator parses the issue body for one or more firewall rules, ensuring
that each rule contains all required fields. Supported field labels include
both the legacy format (e.g. "New Source IP(s) or CIDR(s)") and the
simplified format (e.g. "New Source IP"). The validator is case-insensitive
and tolerant of extra whitespace. If any required field is missing or blank,
validation errors are printed between ``VALIDATION_ERRORS_START`` and
``VALIDATION_ERRORS_END`` markers and the script exits with a non-zero status.
Otherwise it prints a success message.

Example usage (from within a GitHub Action):

  python3 .github/scripts/firewall_request_validator.py "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH"

For local testing you can wrap your issue body in a minimal JSON structure:

  {
    "issue": { "body": "### Request ID (REQID): REQ123\n..." }
  }

and pass the resulting JSON file as the first argument to this script.
