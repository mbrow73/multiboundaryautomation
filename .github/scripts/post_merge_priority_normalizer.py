"""
Postâ€‘merge priority normalizer for firewall rules.

After multiple firewall rule changes are merged into the main branch the
priority values assigned at creation time may become sparse or disordered.
This utility scans all `*.auto.tfvars.json` files in the `firewall-requests`
directory, collects every rule, sorts them by their existing priority and
reassigns a fresh, evenly spaced priority starting at 1000.  The rules are
written back to their original files with updated priority values.  Rule
names are intentionally left unchanged; only the `priority` field is
modified.
