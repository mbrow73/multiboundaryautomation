/*
 * boundary_map.json defines the mapping between IP address ranges and
 * logical boundaries (VPCs).  Each key is the name of a boundary
 * (used in `vpc_boundaries`), and the value is a list of CIDR blocks
 * representing IP ranges that belong to that boundary.  The mapper
 * script will use these definitions to determine the appropriate
 * src_vpc and dest_vpc for each firewall rule based on its IP ranges.
 *
 * PLEASE customize these CIDR blocks to match your environment.  The
 * default values here are illustrative only.
